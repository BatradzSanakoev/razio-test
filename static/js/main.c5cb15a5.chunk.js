It features an over-the-shoulder free camera, a departure from the previous installments, which featured a fixed cinematic camera (with the exception of 2007's two-dimensional side-scroller Betrayal). Cinematographically, the game is presented in a continuous shot, with no camera cuts or loading screens. Although the previous main installment, Ascension (2013), introduced multiplayer to the series, this installment is single-player-only. Regarding the level structure, director Cory Barlog said \"it's open, but it is not an open world.\" Due to its openness, a fast travel feature is unlocked later in the game. Swimming, an ability in previous games, was cut; players instead use a boat to traverse bodies of water. Unlike previous games, which allowed players to jump freely at anytime, jumping can now only be done at designated areas, such as at a rockface or ledge. Throughout the game, players battle Norse mythological foes, like dark elves, wulvers, draugrs, as well as Gullveig and the revenants, beings warped by sei\xf0r magic, among many others. Valkyries appear as optional boss battles. Among the many side quests, players can free the imprisoned dragons F\xe1fnir, Otr, and Reginn\u2014dwarfs who were turned into dragons\u2014in addition to battling one called Hr\xe6zlyr, a story-based boss battle."})]})})]}),Object(d.jsxs)(l.o,{children:[Object(d.jsx)(l.f,{size:"6",className:"col",children:Object(d.jsxs)(l.c,{className:"card",children:[Object(d.jsx)(l.e,{className:"card-header",children:"The Last of Us (2013)"}),Object(d.jsx)(l.d,{className:"card-content",children:"The Last of Us is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment.

Players use firearms and improvised weapons, and can use stealth to defend against hostile humans and cannibalistic creatures infected by a mutated fungus in the genus Cordyceps. In the online multiplayer mode, up to eight players engage in cooperative and competitive gameplay. Development of The Last of Us began in 2009, soon after the release of Naughty Dog's previous game, Uncharted 2: Among Thieves. For the first time in the company's history, Naughty Dog split into two teams; while one team developed Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, the other half developed The Last of Us. The relationship between Joel and Ellie became the focus, with all other elements developed around it. Actors Troy Baker and Ashley Johnson portrayed Joel and Ellie respectively through voice and motion capture, and assisted creative director Neil Druckmann with the development of the characters and story.

The game was released on July 17, 2020 for PlayStation 4. It received praise for its visuals and combat, but was criticized for its open world activities. Ghost of Tsushima also earned several award nominations and wins, and sold over 5 million copies as of November 2020. Ghost of Tsushima is an action-adventure stealth game played from a third-person perspective. The game features a large open world, without waypoints, which can be explored without guidance. Players can travel to different parts of the world on horseback. An item that acts as a grappling hook is available to access difficult to reach areas. The game features side quests and non-playable characters with which the player can interact. A multiplayer mode titled Legends was released in late 2020. Players can complete story missions based on Japanese folklore with another player. A horde mode, in which players fight waves of enemies, is also available for a group of four players.
